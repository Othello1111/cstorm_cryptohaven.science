This is a git repository containing Cryptostorm related stuff.


...which has been shamelessly Borg-forked, renamed from its original (and informative) "fermi-cryptostorm" to the mysterious-bordering-on-meaningless "samizdat-inbound" title you see here :-)

Idea being to use this as a a frame within which we build from the core of Fermi's iptables contributions, in advance of cryptostorm's 3.0 version widget, known simply as 'samizdat.'

And "inbound" is cstorm-newspeak for "client-side stuff" where "outbound" we will be using to define server-side resources that relate to cstorm network traffic transiting out to non-cstorm resources. Which isn't entirely stupid, in terms of naming... only partially. We hope.

So there you go :-)
